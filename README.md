# Python Tutorial Series

Contained within this repo is a series of tutorials on various library/python itself which may be useful to others.
Intention is a quick reference guide to myself as to how to use all of the wierd and wonderful things I do on a day to day basis.
These tutorials will be presented as "Literate" code, i.e. code with diagrams/equations/written explanations in an attempt to integrate them all into a cohesive document.
Eventually I may expand these into a series of long form tutorials
